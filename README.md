## Hacker News posts strategy
In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

__Through our data analysis of HN, we'll identify the best post strategy to get the most comments and so attract the most visibility.__
